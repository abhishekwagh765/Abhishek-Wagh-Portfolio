Cybersecurity enthusiast with hands-on experience in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and incident response. As a Cybersecurity Analyst Intern at Aarna Technologies, I gained expertise in real-time threat analysis, malware detection, and security event management using industry-standard tools. My technical skills include ethical hacking, network analysis, and malware analysis, with certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and Certified in Cybersecurity (ISC2) bolstering my credentials. Proficient in tools like Nessus, Metasploit, and Wireshark, I am passionate about leveraging advanced methodologies to address complex cybersecurity challenges and enhance security resilience.



I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in Cybersecurity and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has cultivated a deep passion for cybersecurity, driving me to pursue a transition into this dynamic field. I am particularly focused on securing a role in Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), where I can leverage my technical expertise and hands-on experience to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities effectively.
